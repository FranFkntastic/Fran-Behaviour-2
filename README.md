# Fran-Behaviour-2
Public Repository for FranFknTastic's Custom Forge 1.18.2 Modpack

Welcome to the Fran Behaviour 2 Github repo! In here I'll post all the contents of the typical single player instance except for the mods, which can be downloaded through either source listed below. There is also a clean rar file with only the mods zipped in the community discord at discord.gg/nt8HewU.

If you encounter any issues, bugs or have feature/config requests, you can always ping me in discord about it but I also appreciate if you could put it on the issue tracker as well!

Wiki page soonTM

Update folders (6,7 etc.) are just for tracking changes in the modlist and do not need to be added to the mods folder as it exists. Everything you should need to play on the live server is already in the mods folder!
You also don't need to copy the config file unless you want my configs, which in fairness are a little more intuitive than defaults.
