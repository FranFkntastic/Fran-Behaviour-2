```
Not Planned:
Artifacts
  - No longer maintained, + redundant with Apotheosis' charms.
Construction Wands
  - Effortless building provides mostly the same functionality without the need to craft a tool for it.
Corail tombstone
adds an extra competing magic system which is kind of anemic and adds a lot of redundancy in a way that isn't particularly unique or special
Create: Netherless
  - i believe going to hell is a character building experience and removing the need will stunt emotional maturity and ability to confront adversity (going to hell)
Curious Lanterns
  - Requires radiant gear as a dependency and I'm iffy adding anything that touches the lighting engine at this point, especially when dealing with older fabric -> forge ports that aren't frequently maintained.
Decorative Blocks
Dragon Additions
  - Scope creep
Functional Storage
	- Not different enough from storage drawers to warrant replacement or addition
Ice & Fire + Addons
	- It's just a lot, man. Might change when I get the time to look through it all and configure it to fit.
Iron Furnaces
	- all the work is done at the crafting bench. discourages more creative smelting/smoking etc. setups
Openblocks Elevators
	- one block elevator solution, similar reasoning as above
Tinker's Thinking
	- Feels amateurish


Planned to Remove:

Ars Omega

Planned to Add:

Ars Instrumentum
Create: Big Cannons
Create: Copies and Cats
Create: Diesel Generators
Create: Alloyed
Create: Slice & Dice
Create: Design & Decor
Create: Steam & Rails
  - i fucking love trains
Computercraft (whatever the newest fork is idk)
Corpse
Corail Woodcutter
Enigmatic Legacy
  - this one is a little more centralizing than I would typically like but it does it in a way that doesn't feel like it steps on other mods toes.
Integrated Dynamics (ONLY BASE)
MmmMmmMmmMmm
	-	Target dummy mod
Pylons
Rechiseled + Rechiseled Create
Toggle Enchantments

Planned to Add After Tuning:

Artifacts
Tinker's Construct
Tinker's Leveling
Better Combat with Tinker's Support (compat)
Chromatic Arsenal
  - Duality rings will need to be changed to not be overtuned with Spice of Life
Dragon Survival
  - cool as fuck but I do NOT know enough about how it works to just drop it in the pack without figuring it out first.
Farming for Blockheads
	- Most stuff is fine except for the market block, which ships a little too convenient for too little cost. Will probably add this with market disabled initially
Merge Enchantments
	- needs investigation
Tons of Enchants
	- love me a good enchantment mod but some of the ones this adds are a little uninspired / too powerful

Considering:

Create: Broken Bad + Usable Product
  - funny but also like zero documentation and a bit thematically dissonant
Create: Misc and Things
  - A lot of really cool and convenient additions but also some items with the potential to cause problems (mending rune, for one).
Create: Dreams & Desires
  - I'd say this mod looked cool if I had any fucking clue what it added. Zero documentation except for some vague images. No wiki, no relevant pins or resources in the dev discord. 
  - okay wow yeah this adds a lot. low priority to implement
Enchanting Infuser
  - gut reaction is to deny based on redundancy with apotheosis, but could be a convenient alternative that coexists with some tuning. Need to investigate compatibility
Forbidden & Arcanus
	- lot of stuff, looks cool and I've heard good things but I know next to nothing about it. 
Materialis
	- need to see what additional functions new materials add in case any are a bit too wild
Chipped
  - Looks rad as fuck but also might hurt parity with other servers for builds saved with create schematics + compat
Security Craft
	- has cool features but needs config tuning
